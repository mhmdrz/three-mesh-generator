This project is an Angular application that leverages Three.js and WebGL shaders to randomly generate stunning 3D meshes. Each refresh provides a unique, visually appealing mesh with dynamically applied shader materials. Additionally, it supports exporting generated meshes and scenes in PNG, WEBM, and JSON formats.
